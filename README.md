# Maze
A simple randomized maze generator

Originally developed as an early C assignment, this recursive version was a slimmer and sleeker challenge to a different template - which relied on testing and setting "directions" each time it was called. The original template also hard-coded the maze, rather than attempting to create one from scratch, so a maze generator function was made.

The randomization may create ridiculously easy mazes, and very often unsolveable ones - however the program will check for validity before it prints to user, since nobody likes an unsolveable puzzle. Additionally, due to the way the function checks its directions, will not be the brightest in its traversal, and may take a horribly silly pathway to the exit. 

There were a lot of hiccups in developing the game, but it was a learning experience for an intro class.

For Portfolio.
